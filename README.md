# Student-management-System
This is a student data management website created using HTML, CSS, PHP and MySql. The website provides the user with CRUD functions.

It allows students to see their records by entering Admission number, rollno, name, date of birth and email.
As per the admin privilages,
Students can
1. Insert student records,
2. Update student records,
3. Delete student records.

I created MySql database in PHP My Admin and hence if you wish to use the code, create a database in my case,
database name : student-management
Create a table one for student. In my case the table name is student
Also, I have used XAAMP server and for using PHP My Admin, my username was root and password was"". In case you have a different one, edit it in the db.php file.


*the website is not complete.functions like admin and admin privileges will be added later.
